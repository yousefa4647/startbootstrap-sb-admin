<h4> Bitcoin, being unaffiliated with any corporation or bank is extremely hard to track. This lead to it being a currency on the Deep Web where criminals are able to sell a range of illegal items from weapons to drugs to videos featuring child exploitation. As a result, there are politicians both within the United States and in other countries who are looking to ban/place restrictions on the cryptocurrency.
Because of Bitcoins un predictable nature, it's vulnerbility to criminal hacking, and potential government restrictions, I believe Bitcoin isnt worth investing in However, this is as of right now due to it still being new and the recent economic shutdown This doesnt mean you shouldnt entirely forget about it and you should still look out for trends and the potential of it skyrocketing like stocks after crises
