   <h4>The domain name "bitcoin.org" was registered on 18 August 2008.On 31 October 2008, a link to a paper authored by Satoshi Nakamoto titled Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System was posted to a cryptography mailing list. Nakamoto implemented the bitcoin software as open-source code and released it in January 2009 Nakamoto's identity remains unknown. It was worth 8 cents when it first came out but in 10 years skyrocketed to 8,092 dollars which means that those who bought multiple then would have certainly made a fortune now.</h4>
